# Watch Kannappa Telugu Movie - Review, Rating & Final Verdict.

<Breadcrumbs />

Kannappa telugu movie is based on a true story about the life of bhakta kannappa which had happened in the olden period. The story is all about the devotional faith of lord shiva and his devotee bhakta kannappa. The star cast mohan babu, manchu vishnu, prabhas, etc had played a major role in this movie. When I was watching the trailer in telugu, I was really shocked by seeing the star cast mainly Prabhas as a devotee to lord shiva which really made me more excited about the movie. Kannappa was released in theaters and also in OTT platforms and streaming in different languages.

## Plot / Summary (No Spoiler's):

Kannappa movie tells the story of the lord shiva devotee named Kannappa which is a real biography. This movie was directed by Mukesh kumar singh in which he had put his best efforts. As the plot turns out, there is a son of a tribal leader called Tinnadu who does not believe in all the devotional worship and its rituals. During his early ages, he had experienced an unwanted ritual resulting in losing his best friend, from then he wont trust in any devotional worshipping to god including lord shiva.

On the other hand, one of the best devotees in the world is lord shiva in avatar of vayu lingham in which mohan babu played a cameo role. While the plot goes on there will be interesting twists and extraordinary performances of the star cast. I really loved watching the movie and mostly the acting of the post.

## Review:

### What had worked:

In this movie the most performed star actor and actress had given their best performances in their roles. The star actors Mohanbabu, Manchu Vishnu, Prabhas, Mohanlal etc. was the soul of this movie. Stephen Devessay who had done music direction had made a major plus point for this movie. I personally loved the song shivayya shivayya in this movie and had listened to it more than ten thousand times till today.

In the plot, one scene I loved the most was the climax scene where Tinnadu had done his 100% soulfull worship to lord shiva even though he didn't hesitate to give his eyes to lord shiva. The prominent scene was really a heart touching scene for me till today. As the whole movie runs between the lord shiva and his devotee thinnadu who is also known as bhakta kannapa in real world. Of all the epic scenes, the most interesting was found in this movie with the latest visuals and updates. This was really a much watched movie.

### What Didn't Worked:

In most of my movie reviews, I had written something in this section, but when it comes to kannappa movie, as it was based on the real story of the greatest devotee of lord shiva, i wont be having anything in my mind as to judge on this movie. All the scenes, music, everything I loved the most and really really grateful to watch this movie this year.
