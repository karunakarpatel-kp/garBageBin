## Review:

### What worked out:

This movie is all about owning an 3BHK house by a simple and ordinary middle class family. In this movie Siddarth and Sarathkumar had played an prominent role as i had even forgotten they were belong to start hero family. Hero siddarth and sarathkumar as a father had puts an intense relation between them which i had loved the most during watching out this movie. The voice over of Rana Daggubati's had added so much value to the opening scenes.

This movie was directed by sri Ganesh as he had done a wonderful job in his writings. But as the movie goes on i felt it at some places, the writing and direction and the screenplay had not matched each other. Lets check down below as i had included in what didn't worked out in this movie. Overall, the acting, music director, cinematography, visuals, emotional impact and the dialogues were really original and i loved the most but at one point they hadnot reached out the level as i had expected during watching the teaser and trailer.

### What Didn't Work:

In this movie the major issue was with the screenplay. While the writings and directions of the movie is really simple and genuine, i feel that the screenplay was not really upto the mark.
Especially when yogi babu entered the move, i had almost expected to relieve from all the stress and twist, confusion from the movie but that did not happened. I had already expected the funny jokes even before they played on the screen. I really hated that part. Throughout the movie i felt some scenes are lagging and repeating 2 to 3 times and finally expected some scenes even before.
