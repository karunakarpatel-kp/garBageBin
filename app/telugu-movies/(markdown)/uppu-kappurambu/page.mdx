## Plot / Summary (No Spoiler's):

Uppu kappurambu movie is really based on the olden culture in villages during 1990's. Hero suhas was lived in this village working as a kati kapiri who performs rights in funeral ground. In the same village actress keerthi suresh was a sarpanch of the villages. Both got their duties from their heredatory process.

By the excellent writing of the director Sasi, this drama is all about the place and the members of the villagers who want to take place in the funeral ground after they die. During the process of counting the remaining empty places in the funeral ground there are only 4 left for the rest of the villages.

All the plot turns around between the 4 empty spaces in the funeral ground and the villagers. As the drama went on, I found very interesting twists and unexpected turns which made the audience very enthusiastic.

## Review:

### What worked:

In this movie, the star cast Keerthi Suresh and Suhas had given their ultimate performances among them Suhas has lived in the role. I personally loved the writing of Sasi and his directions from his early career. This movie was his best movie that I had watched in his direction. Overall, the music director and the whole cast including the visuals, background score etc. had given their best in this movie. Mostly, the timing of the comedy was really very well crafted and directed by Sahi.

### What Didn't Worked:

I personally felt that in this drama, the plot was very interesting but at some places I had experienced some lagging in some scenes. Mostly, when it comes to visuals, all the movie scenes were only within the three to four houses which gave me a feeling of something is missing. At the very final ending of the movie, the plot had ended unexpectedly and mostly the realisating part of the villages had done very quickly which had made me confused. Overall when it comes to unity of villagers this movie is a must watch.
