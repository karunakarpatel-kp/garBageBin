# Watch Kubera Telugu Movie - Honest Review, Story, and Verdict

<Breadcrumbs />

**Kubera** is a very interesting telugu drama directed by shekar kammula which combines emotion, social drama, twists and powerful performances. The powerful cast which includes Nagarjuna, Dhanush and Rashmika had given wonderful performances and I personally felt that they acted under the direction of shekar kammula. In this three hour movie, the whole drama had made the whole audience stick with the story and mingle themselves.

## Story summary:

Kubera tells the story of a sincere CBI officer who finds himself in jail, only to be unexpectedly released by one of the richest men in the country. The billionaire hires him for a secret mission — to turn black money into white using the officer's intelligence and government officials including the politicians.

Things go smoothly at first, but the plot takes a surprising twist when four beggars unexpectedly enter the story, making the money laundering process more complicated and even had stopped at once and for all. Over time, the CBI officer has a change of heart and turns against the billionaire, ultimately helping the poor — especially one beggar who plays a major role and sacrifices himself for a greater cause and at the very final step he had succeeded.

## Review

### What Worked:

I've always admired Shekar Kammula's direction — he may not make many films, but each one is meaningful. In Kubera, his role of the beggar character was both emotional and impactful which I had loved the most.

Dhanush, who played the major beggar role, was really outstanding and phenomenal and extraordinary. His performance was the soul of the whole movie. One scene that stayed with me was when he eats food while being chased by villains and nagarjuna— a powerful mix of desperation and humanity.

### What Didn't Worked:

While the story and execution were impressive, the ending felt rushed. The villain's arc, in particular, could have used more time to fully develop and leave a lasting impact.

## Conclusion:

I highly recommend Kubera for its performances and thought-provoking storyline. The cast did a phenomenal job, and the emotional beats land beautifully.

#### My Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
