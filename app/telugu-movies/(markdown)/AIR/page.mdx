# Watch AIR Telugu Movie WebSeries - My Review and Ratings.

<Breadcrumbs />

AIR telugu movie web series is all about the life and educational conditions of teenage students especially who are studying intermediate education. When I watched the trailer, I was really surprised to see the actor Sunil playing the founder of the AIR role in this webseries. As there are twelve episodes in this season in which one episode marks the ultimate acting roles than the other. Joseph Clinton directed this webseries very well.

AIR telugu webseries was released in ETV Win ott platforms and streaming in different languages. If you have not watched it yet, please watch it on the app and share with me your comments in the comment section as I will be sharing my review below.

## Plot / Summary (No Spoiler's):

AIR Telugu webseries was really about the story of three teenagers who are studying their intermediate education. In the plot, among the three teenagers one belongs to a middle class family, one belongs to a rich kid and the other belongs to the poor family who got a free seat in AIR college. Things go smoothly at first, but later, the plot twists unexpectedly in the drama.

The whole plot turns between three friends who find it hard to adjust to the environment and they try to walk away with the pressure. During the plot one unexpected incident happens as they fell into some serious trouble and the whole story tells you how three friends handled their emotions and real life experimentations.

## Review:

## What Had Worked?

I personally felt that the performances of Harsh Roshan had done an outstanding job. His dialogue delivery was really good. Meanwhile Bhanu prasad and jayatheertha supported him very well. They had also done a good job in supporting the hero and mostly the friendship between the three was really great.

### Final Verdict:

As per my personal thoughts AIR (All India Rankers ) is a must watch series for the teenagers. The young cast had done a commendable job in which the plot brings the plenty of hostel and college sweet memories back to us. It is really worth a watch for those who had faced challenges in their college and hostel life. Finally, AIR ( All India Rankers) would really leave you with a smile at the end.

### My Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars
