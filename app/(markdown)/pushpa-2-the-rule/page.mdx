## Plot Overview:

A shipment of red sandalwood reaches Yokohama port in Japan, but the workers are shocked to find Pushpa hiding inside one of the containers. He fights with them, demanding payment for the goods, but gets shot and falls into the sea, leading to a flashback of his journey.

After publicly embarrassing **SP Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat**, Pushpa becomes a powerful and respected smuggler, while Shekhawat goes into hiding. Shekhawat, now disguised as a laborer, tries to disrupt Pushpa's business by intercepting a large sandalwood shipment. Around the same time, Pushpa meets the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Narasimha Reddy, but is denied a photo opportunity to avoid political problems. Feeling insulted, Pushpa vows to overthrow the government by making Siddappa the Chief Minister and starts raising ₹500 crores through sandalwood smuggling.

**Pushpa** makes a deal with Central Minister Kogatam Veera Pratap Reddy and travels to the Maldives to sell 2,000 tons of sandalwood for ₹5,000 crores to an international buyer named Hameed. As his smuggling network grows, rivals like Mangalam Srinu, Dakshayani, and Shekhawat team up to sabotage his plans. Shekhawat kills a key member of Pushpa's group, scaring the others and pressuring Pushpa to step down as their leader.

Despite the setbacks, **Pushpa** cleverly manages to smuggle the sandalwood to Chennai and then to Sri Lanka. During the operation, Shekhawat attacks and destroys the trucks, forcing the drivers to flee. The media praises Shekhawat for his success, but it turns out the shipment was not real sandalwood, but Sandra—a lookalike wood with no value. Pushpa had secretly used bullock carts to move the actual sandalwood, unknowingly getting help from Shekhawat's actions.

Shekhawat later gets permission to follow the consignment to Rameswaram but fails to stop it before it reaches Sri Lanka. Frustrated, he burns the storage site and appears to die in the fire. Meanwhile, Srivalli finds out she is pregnant, and **Pushpa** celebrates the happy news. But things take a dark turn when Pushpa's niece, Kaveri, is attacked during a festival and kidnapped by Bugga Reddy, the nephew of Veera Pratap Reddy. Pushpa rescues each and every one. After this, Pushpa reunites with his family and celebrates Kaveri's wedding. However, tragedy strikes again when a mysterious person plants a bomb at the wedding, leaving everyone in shock.
